# one-page-sites
A collection of one-file, self-contained webpages I've created. Each html file can be downloaded and independently used offline as long as the device you launch it on has a mainstream, up-to-date webbrowser. I would recommend using a Chromium based browser to avoid compatibility issues arising from a lack of polyfills (which I did take the time to add).
